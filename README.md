## Installation

## Usage

## Examples

## Why?

> If your project does something already catered for by another project or is particularly complex, it’s useful to provide some justification.

## Contributing

See the [contribution guide][info-contribute].

## Support and Migration

> A section on the support status of your project is very helpful, especially once you’ve released a few different major versions. This section is mostly useful to existing users who may need some hand-holding through a migration between major versions of your project.
>
> A full migration guide might be a bit long to add to your README, I use a `MIGRATION` file in the root of my project repositories and link to it from this section ([see pa11y for an example](https://github.com/springernature/pa11y/blob/master/MIGRATION.md)).

## Common Questions

> A place for frequently asked questions, to reduce duplicate issues being opened.
